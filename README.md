# Hexapod-Robot-Senior-Capstone
The collection of files created for my group's ECE 492: Capstone Design project

This contains files for the Fall 2018 Capstone Hexapod Walking Robot, built by Kara Fortunato, Justin Ross, and Justin Purtell.

The Projects folder contains the project folders for both the Tiva-C and the Node MCU. The Tiva-C folder is a Code Composer Studio Project.

The Source Code folder just contains the source code for each board. The Tiva-C source code contains a semi-extensive Servo library that was used to abstract away some complexities.

The Inventor Parts folder are all of the Autodesk Inventor parts that were modeled and later used for laser cutting.

The Final_Drawing.dwg is the actual file that a Universal Laser Systems Laser Cutter use to cut the parts.

There are also some instructions on how to connect to the Wifi-board

There was a vote to name it, and as voted on, her name is now Charlotte!
Enjoy!
